# React Weather App
The weather APP is an application developed on [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) build tool. This is a Frontend Web Application that makes request to the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get Current Weather Data and 5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast data.

## Functionality
The Weather application has a search function where a user can enter a location from anywhere in the world and this location is used to make an [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) call to the OpenWeather API endpoints for [Current Weather data](https://openweathermap.org/current) and [5 day weather forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5). The weather data returned are then presented dynamically on the screen.
